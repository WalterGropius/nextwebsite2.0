# Performance Analysis Report

## Current Performance Issues

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

1. **Large Image Files**
   - Total image size: ~50MB+ (estimated)
   - Some images are 3.8MB+ (image08.png)
   - All images are PNG format (not optimized)
   - No lazy loading implemented

2. **Slow Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
   - Likely caused by large images loading
   - No image optimization or WebP format
   - No responsive images

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Issues

1. **Framer Motion Overuse**
   - Multiple motion components on page load
   - Complex animations running simultaneously
   - No animation throttling

2. **Three.js Performance**
   - Complex 3D scene with Flowers component
   - No LOD (Level of Detail) system
   - Continuous animations running

3. **Network Performance**
   - No CDN for static assets
   - Large bundle size
   - No code splitting for heavy components

## Performance Debugging Tools

### Usage
- **Ctrl+Shift+P**: Toggle Performance Debugger (real-time metrics)
- **Ctrl+Shift+A**: Toggle Performance Analysis (detailed issues)

### Metrics Tracked
- Core Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB)
- Image count and total size
- Three.js object count
- Framer Motion component count
- Memory usage

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Image Optimization (Priority: Critical)

```bash
# Run image optimization script
node scripts/optimize-images.js
```

**Actions:**
- Convert PNG to WebP format (50-80% smaller)
- Implement responsive images with different sizes
- Add lazy loading for images below the fold
- Use `next/image` with proper `sizes` attribute
- Consider using a CDN for image delivery

### 2. Code Splitting (Priority: High)

```javascript
// Lazy load heavy components
const Creations = lazy(() => import('@/components/creations'))
const Flowers = lazy(() => import('@/components/canvas/Flowers'))
```

**Actions:**
- Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
- Split bundle by route
- Lazy load Three.js components
- Use React.lazy for component-level code splitting

### 3. Animation Optimization (Priority: Medium)

```javascript
// Reduce Framer Motion complexity
const containerAnimation = useMemo(() => ({
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  show: { opacity: 1, transition: { staggerChildren: 0.05 } }
}), [])
```

**Actions:**
- Reduce animation complexity
- Use CSS transitions for simple animations
- Implement animation throttling
- Disable animations on low-end devices

### 4. Three.js Optimization (Priority: Medium)

```javascript
// Optimize Three.js scene
<Canvas
  performance={{ min: 0.5 }}
  dpr={[1, 2]}
  gl={{ powerPreference: "high-performance" }}
>
```

**Actions:**
- Reduce scene complexity
- Implement LOD system
- Optimize lighting setup
- Use lower quality on mobile devices

### 5. Bundle Optimization (Priority: High)

```javascript
// next.config.js optimizations
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    optimizeCss: true,
    optimizePackageImports: ['@react-three/fiber', '@react-three/drei']
  },
  images: {
    formats: ['image/webp'],
    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],
    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
  }
}
```
